Version 0.3.0 (BETA)

  * Released first web version of old sheets
  * Implemented backup and restore functionality using json.
    * It is recommended to backup if you ever clear browser cache or before utilizing the clear data option.
    * This function may be used to save multiple taoists for ease of swapping between character views. 
    * you may optionally edit this json directly using your preferred text editor instead of using the UI.

	Limitations / Known issues
	  NOTE - THIS IS NOT YET RELEASED: VIRYA, FRUITS, ELIXERS, BENEDICTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT YET READY			
      This is a hobby project, and as such do not expect regular updates or support. It is not 100% accurate, but rather a snapshot of your stats. It will provide a "worst case" scenario based on what has been inputted, assuming you have inputted everything correctly.
			Debug Data is not yet santitized and ready for player use. For example, cosmoapsis is not currently displaying properly.
			Percentages exceeding 100% are not yet handled for major breakthroughs
      Mobile browser is largely untested, however backup and import functions do not seem to work there.

Acknowledgments

  Thank you for trying out my take on the old google sheets calculator! Inspiration came from the calculator mentioned in the footer, which is currently maintained by Yutsu.
	I also wish to thank Endless for the great effort they have put into educating this lowley taoist in the ways of the dao, as well as 'R' for encouraging me along the way while i developed this version of the calculator.
	If you have questions or requests, please add me on discord and mention that you have been directed from this calculator. For any bug reports, please include a copy of your exported json and screenshots from your taoist. 
  
  Best Regards,
